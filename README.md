# Machine Learning Classification algorithms 
This repository contains is a python implementation of simple pipeline to test a large number of machine learning classification algorithms. The goal is to provide a simple script that allows practitioners to analyse:

- Prediction performance with ML algorithms.
- Variable importance through a simple "add one variable in each run" and comparing performance.


## Dependencies
The Sklearn package that includes the suite of algorithms and performance metrics.

## First steps
The python notebook is self contained and will guide you through the whole pipeline.
